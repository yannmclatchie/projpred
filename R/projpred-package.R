#' @description
#'
#' The \R package \pkg{projpred} performs the projection predictive variable (or
#' "feature") selection for various regression models. We recommend to read the
#' `README` file (available with enhanced formatting
#' [online](https://mc-stan.org/projpred/)) and the main vignette (`topic =
#' "projpred"`, but also available
#' [online](https://mc-stan.org/projpred/articles/projpred.html)) before
#' continuing here.
#'
#' For the sake of simplicity (throughout the whole package documentation), we
#' use the term "submodel" for all kinds of candidate models onto which the
#' reference model is projected, even though this term is not always appropriate
#' for custom reference models.
#'
#' The following model type abbreviations will be used at multiple places
#' throughout the documentation: GLM (generalized linear model), GLMM
#' (generalized linear multilevel---or "mixed"---model), GAM (generalized
#' additive model), and GAMM (generalized additive multilevel---or
#' "mixed"---model). Note that the term "generalized" includes the Gaussian
#' family as well.
#'
#' For the projection of the reference model onto a submodel, \pkg{projpred}
#' currently relies on the following functions (in other words, these are the
#' workhorse functions used by the default divergence minimizer):
#' * Submodel without multilevel or additive terms: An internal C++ function
#' which basically serves the same purpose as [lm()] for the [gaussian()] family
#' and [glm()] for all other families.
#' * Submodel with multilevel but no additive terms: [lme4::lmer()] for the
#' [gaussian()] family, [lme4::glmer()] for all other families.
#' * Submodel without multilevel but additive terms: [mgcv::gam()].
#' * Submodel with multilevel and additive terms: [gamm4::gamm4()].
#'
#' The projection of the reference model onto a submodel can be run on multiple
#' CPU cores in parallel (across the projected draws). This is powered by the
#' \pkg{foreach} package. Thus, any parallel (or sequential) backend compatible
#' with \pkg{foreach} can be used, e.g., the backends from packages
#' \pkg{doParallel}, \pkg{doMPI}, or \pkg{doFuture}. Using the global option
#' `projpred.prll_prj_trigger`, the number of projected draws below which no
#' parallelization is applied (even if a parallel backend is registered) can be
#' modified. Such a "trigger" threshold exists because of the computational
#' overhead of a parallelization which makes parallelization only useful for a
#' sufficiently large number of projected draws. By default, parallelization is
#' turned off, which can also be achieved by supplying `Inf` (or `NULL`) to
#' option `projpred.prll_prj_trigger`. Note that we cannot recommend
#' parallelizing the projection on Windows because in our experience, the
#' parallelization overhead is larger there, causing a parallel run to take
#' longer than a sequential run. Also note that the parallelization works well
#' for GLMs, but for GLMMs, GAMs, and GAMMs, the fitted model objects are quite
#' big, which---when running in parallel---may lead to an excessive memory usage
#' which in turn may crash the R session. Thus, we currently cannot recommend
#' the parallelization for GLMMs, GAMs, and GAMMs.

#'   \item{[init_refmodel()], [get_refmodel()]}{For setting up a reference model
#'   (only rarely needed explicitly).}

#'   results from the variable selection.}
#'   \item{[project()]}{For projecting the reference model onto submodel(s).
#'   Typically, this follows the variable selection, but it can also be applied
#'   directly (without a variable selection).}
